 * open_watchdog() opens watchdog device file, which also starts watchdog

 *     The caller needs to kick the watchdog itself (by kick_watchdog()),
 *     and the second parameter <auto_kick_interval> is ignored.
 *   - auto-kick mode (<auto_kick> != 0):
 *     open_watchdog() function will create a separate thread which kicks
 *     watchdog peridically, and kick interval is specified by the second
 *     parameter <auto_kick_interval>.
 * The function returns 0 for success, and -1 on failures.
 * NOTES:
 *   - In linux 4.17, open_watchdog() can be called only once, and
 *     subsequent calls would fail (no matter it's called from current
 *     or different processes).
